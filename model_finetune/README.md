# Finetuning

## Required Libraries
We have tested this with CUDA version 12.1. Other versions can also work, but may require changing the library versions installed.

To install all of the necessary libraries, first create a conda environment:
```
conda create -n sft_code_opt python=3.10
```

Then, activate the conda environment by running: `conda activate sft_code_opt` and install all of the necessary libraries by running:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The versions of these libraries have been tested to work and may not be compatible with the ones installed by the libraries used in model evaluation. While it may be possible to use the same environment to do both fine-tuning and evaluation, it is not recommended.

## Dataset
The sample finetuning code assumes the dataset follows the format described [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/speedcode/LLM4PP_dataset). We also provide a sample dataset based on Leetcode problems at that link.

## Running Supervised Fine-Tuning
The sample code runs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using FSDP via `accelerate`. A sample config file is also provided, although you can adjust it for your own setting.

Some of the fine-tuning code is taken from [PIE](https://github.com/LearningOpt/pie).

To run the finetuning code for code optimization, an example command is:

```
accelerate launch --config_file fsdp_config.yaml sft_code_opt.py \
    --model_name "deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-6.7b-base" \
    --dataset_path speedcode/LLM4PP_dataset \
    --output_dir $OUTPUT_DIR \
    --num_train_epochs 5 \
    --per_device_train_batch_size 8 \
    --per_device_eval_batch_size 1 \
    --evaluation_strategy "no" \
    --save_strategy "no" \
    --learning_rate 1e-5 \
    --logging_steps 1 \
    --bf16 True \
```
